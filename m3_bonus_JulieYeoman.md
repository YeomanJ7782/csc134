I'm a first year C++ programmer, and we've just learned if statements. My instructor wanted me to ask you, as a C++ expert, how to build on that to make a simple game that does (GAME IDEA). He said it's fine to use loops and functions, but don't get more complicated than that.
hat’s a great question — and exactly the kind of thing a good instructor would have you ask. 👍

So here’s how I’d help you as a first-year C++ student:

Step 1: Start from What You Know

Right now, you’ve learned:

Variables (to store information)

if statements (to make decisions)

You can already make small “choose your path” or “win or lose” style games with just those two things.

Example:

if (guess == secretNumber) {
    cout << "You win!";
} else {
    cout << "Try again!";
}

Step 2: Add Loops

Loops let the player keep trying, play multiple rounds, or stay in the game until something happens.

Example:

while (guess != secretNumber) {
    cout << "Try again: ";
    cin >> guess;
}


Now you’ve got repetition — the heart of a game.

🧩 Step 3: Add Functions

Functions make your code cleaner and easier to read. You can move game logic into separate blocks like this:

int rollDice() {
    return rand() % 6 + 1;
}


This lets you focus on logic instead of writing everything in main().

🎮 Step 4: Apply It to Your (GAME IDEA)

You didn’t tell me your game idea yet — and that’s the key next step.
Once you tell me what kind of game you want to make (for example: Craps, Rock-Paper-Scissors, Number Guessing, Adventure Choices, etc.),
I’ll help you break it down like this:

Concept	How You’ll Use It
Variables	Store player choices or random numbers
if Statements	Decide who wins or what happens next
Loops	Let the game continue until player quits or wins
Functions	Organize your code into clear pieces
🛠️ Step 5: Build It Step-by-Step

We’ll start with a simple version that works, then layer in more fun (like scoring, replay, or difficulty).
